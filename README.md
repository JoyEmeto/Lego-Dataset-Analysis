# Lego-Dataset-Analysis
Exploring the Evolution of Lego

This is a data analysis project from DataCamp.
This project answers the following questions:
* What percentage of all Licensed sets ever releases were Star Wars themed?
NB: Save your answer as a variable 'the_force' in the form of an integer (e.g. 25)
* In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme (in terms of number of sets released that year)?
Save your answer as a variable 'new_era' in the form of an integer (e.g. 2012)
* What year had the most number of sets?

To do this analysis I used the Pandas library of Python.
